I have showcased advanced state management in React using the useState hook. 
It maintains states for tasks, task input, and filter criteria. 
This approach allows for efficient manipulation and tracking of application data within functional components.

Conditional rendering is effectively utilized to dynamically display tasks based on the selected filter criteria.
The project demonstrates how to conditionally render components by mapping over filtered tasks and updating the DOM accordingly. 
This enhances the user experience by providing a responsive and interactive interface.

The project demonstrates event handling in React through various user interactions.
The onChange event is used to capture input changes in the task input field, enabling real-time updates. 
Additionally, onClick events are employed to handle adding tasks, toggling task completion, and removing tasks. 
This showcases how React efficiently handles user events and triggers appropriate state updates.
